%todo: add pics and links e.g helpful inhaler table, patient info resources etc (take  some from asthma folder), add pathology detail

# Definition

chronic respiratory disease characterized by variable and recurring symptoms (typically intermittant cough, wheeze and breathlessness), airway inflammation, airflow obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

# Epidemiology

- estimated worldwide burden 235 million (WHO), UK has among highest country rates.
- 5.4 million people in UK recieveing rx for asthma, 1 in 11 children, 1 in 12 adults. 3 people die from an asthma attack per day. (asthma UK)

# Aetiology

Causes of asthma are not completely understood. The strongest risk factors for developing asthma are a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental exposure to inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways, such as:

- indoor allergens (for example house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander)
- outdoor allergens (such as pollens and moulds)
- tobacco smoke
- chemical sensitisers and irritants in the workplace
- air pollution

# Pathology

- airway inflammation (mast cells, eosinophils, lymphocytes etc)
- bronchial hyperresponsiveness
- airway remodelling
- modulatory factors (genetic, environmental, infectious)

# Clinical features

## history

- wheeze, cough or breathlessness, and any daily or seasonal variation in these symptoms 
- any triggers that make symptoms worse 
- pulmonary risk factors: occupation, personal/fam hx atopy, smoking, personal hx tb or contact with

## examination

- diffuse polyphonic expiratory wheeze

## investigations

- FeNO; > 40ppb is +ive
- spirometry; fev1/fvc less than 70% is obstructive, bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) test positive if 12% and more than 200ml improvement in FEV1 (BDR should only be offered if obstructive spirometry; more likely to be positive if BD
medication is withheld before test: SABA ≥4 hours, LABA ≥15 hours)
- peak flow variability; monitor peak flow variability for 2-4 weeks, more than 20% variability is positive
- direct bronchial challenge with histamine or methacholine; PC20 value of 8mg/ml or less as a positive test

## diagnosis (According to NICE.. BTS/SIGN guidelines give more weight to clinical diagnosis and put spiro before feno)

can diagnose asthma if have suggestive symptoms one of:
1. feno > 40ppb + BDR or peak flow variability or direct bronchial challenge OR
2. feno 25-39ppb + ive bronchial challenge OR
3. BDR + peak flow variability irrespective of feno

Suspect asthma in adults with symptoms suggestive of asthma, obstructive spirometry and: 
1. -ive BDR, and either a FeNO level of 40ppb or more, or a FeNO level between 25and 39ppb and positive peak flow variability
2. BDR, a FeNO level between 25and 39ppb and negative peak flow variability. 

Do not rule out other diagnoses if symptom control continues to remain poor after treatment. Review the diagnosis after 6to10weeks by repeating spirometry and objective measures of asthma control and reviewing symptoms. 

Consider alternative diagnoses e.g [ILO/VCD](https://www.evidencio.com/models/show/1831), or referral for a second opinion, in adults (aged 17and over) with symptoms suggestive of asthma and: 
1. a FeNO level below 40ppb, normal spirometry and positive peak flow variability
2. a FeNO level of 40ppb or more but normal spirometry, negative peak flow variability, and negative bronchial challenge test
3. obstructive spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility, but a FeNO level below 25ppb, and negative peak flow variability
4. positive peak flow variability but normal spirometry, a FeNO level below 40ppb, and a negative bronchial challenge test
5. obstructive spirometry with negative bronchodilator reversibility, a FeNO level below 25ppb, and negative peak flow variability 

## management and prognosis

- SPT to aeroallergens or specific IgE 
- consider reasons for uncontrolled asthma before escalating treatment: wrong diagnosis, lack of adherence, poor inhaler technique (check it), smoking (active or passive), occupational epxosures, psychosocial factors, seasonal or environmental factors
- review response to treatment adustment in 4-8/52
- check inhaler technique at any asthma review (routine or unscheduled)
- record PEFR and [predicted](https://www.mdcalc.com/estimated-expected-peak-expiratory-flow-peak-flow)
- advise flu vaccine annually and pneumococcal vaccine every 5-10 years
- treatment steps (see table 12 SIGN guidleins for adult ICS dose guide): 
1. SABA (alone if minimal sx and normal lung function)
2. Low dose (<400mcg budesonide or equiv) ICS (asthma related sx 3x / week or causing waking at night / ADL limitation - RCP 3 qs - not relieved by SABA)
3. Add LTRA
4. Add LABA and stop LTRA if it didn't help
5. Offer MART regimen
6. Increase to moderate dose (400mcg-800mcg budesonide or equiv) ICS (MART or not)
7. Increase to high dose (>800mcg budesonide or equiv) ICS (MART or not) OR trial of additional drug e.g LAMA or theophylline OR advice from HCP with asthma expertise (consider azithromyicin, biologics (anti-IgE omalizumab, anti-IL5 mepolizumab and reslizumab and benralizumab, anti-IL4 dupilumab, low dose oral steroids)  
- offer a personalised asthma action plan e.g quadruple regular ICS dose for 7 days when asthma deteriorates (PEF < 80% best), oral steroids and same-day medical advice (PEF < 60% best), urgent medical advice (PEF < 50% best)
- decrease when well controlled for 3/12
- consider using Asthma Control Test for monitoring (asthma control = symptom control + future risk of adverse outcomes)
- risk stratify and communicate risk
