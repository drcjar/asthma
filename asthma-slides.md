# Caveat emptor

#

This is written for a junior doctor audience and is intended to provide an overview of asthma. If you spot a bug or inaccuracy please ping me at [drcjar@gmail.com](drcjar@gmail.com) or submit a pull request [https://github.com/drcjar/asthma/](https://github.com/drcjar/asthma/) and I will fix.

#

With thanks to Smita Adhikari who suggested helpful pictures to me.

# Learning objectives

#

At the conclusion of this activity, participants will be able to...

- define asthma
- describe the basic epidemiology of asthma
- summarise the key clinical features of asthma
- describe the management of asthma
- assess asthma severity and know when and how to refer

# what is asthma?


# 

asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by:

1. variable and recurring symptoms (typically intermittant cough, wheeze and breathlessness)
2. airway inflammation
3. airflow obstruction
4. bronchial hyperresponsiveness

# {data-background="images/asthma_airway.png"}

# who gets asthma?

#

- it's the most common inflammatory disease of the lungs
- estimated worldwide burden 235 million (WHO), UK has among highest country rates
- 5.4 million people in UK recieveing rx for asthma, 1 in 11 children, 1 in 12 adults. 3 people die from an asthma attack per day (asthma UK)
- bimodal age distribution, equal sex distribution below 30-34, more common in men thereafter

# what causes asthma?

#

Causes of asthma are not completely understood. The strongest risk factors for developing asthma are a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental exposure to inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways.

#

potentially relevant exposures

- indoor allergens (for example house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander)
- outdoor allergens (such as pollens and moulds)
- tobacco smoke
- chemical sensitisers and irritants in the workplace
- air pollution

# what's the pathology of asthma?

#

- airway inflammation (mast cells, eosinophils, lymphocytes etc)
- bronchial hyperresponsiveness
- airway remodelling
- modulatory factors (genetic, environmental, infectious)

# {data-background="images/asthma_cells_and_airway.png"}

# how does asthma present?

#

- wheeze, cough or breathlessness, and any daily or seasonal variation in these symptoms 
- any triggers that make symptoms worse 
- pulmonary risk factors: occupation, personal/fam hx atopy, smoking, personal hx tb or contact with
- diffuse polyphonic expiratory wheeze

# what tests are there for asthma?

#

- FeNO; > 40ppb is +ive
- spirometry; fev1/fvc less than 70% is obstructive, bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) test positive if 12% and more than 200ml improvement in FEV1 (BDR should only be offered if obstructive spirometry; more likely to be positive if BD
medication is withheld before test: SABA ≥4 hours, LABA ≥15 hours)

#

- peak flow variability; monitor peak flow variability for 2-4 weeks, more than 20% variability is positive
- direct bronchial challenge with histamine or methacholine; PC20 value of 8mg/ml or less as a positive test

# how is the diagnosis made?

#


(According to NICE.. BTS/SIGN guidelines give more weight to clinical diagnosis and put spiro before feno)

can diagnose asthma if have suggestive symptoms one of:
1. feno > 40ppb + BDR or peak flow variability or direct bronchial challenge OR
2. feno 25-39ppb + ive bronchial challenge OR
3. BDR + peak flow variability irrespective of feno

#

Suspect asthma in adults with symptoms suggestive of asthma, obstructive spirometry and: 
1. -ive BDR, and either a FeNO level of 40ppb or more, or a FeNO level between 25and 39ppb and positive peak flow variability
2. BDR, a FeNO level between 25and 39ppb and negative peak flow variability. 

#

Do not rule out other diagnoses if symptom control continues to remain poor after treatment. Review the diagnosis after 6to10weeks by repeating spirometry and objective measures of asthma control and reviewing symptoms. 

#

Consider alternative diagnoses, or referral for a second opinion, in adults (aged 17 and over) with symptoms suggestive of asthma and: 

#

1. a FeNO level below 40ppb, normal spirometry and positive peak flow variability
2. a FeNO level of 40ppb or more but normal spirometry, negative peak flow variability, and negative bronchial challenge test
3. obstructive spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility, but a FeNO level below 25ppb, and negative peak flow variability

#

4. positive peak flow variability but normal spirometry, a FeNO level below 40ppb, and a negative bronchial challenge test
5. obstructive spirometry with negative bronchodilator reversibility, a FeNO level below 25ppb, and negative peak flow variability 

# How is asthma managed?

#

- establish it is asthma
- assess asthma control (symptom control + future risk of adverse outcomes)
- consider reasons for uncontrolled asthma before escalating treatment
- check inhaler technique

#

- record PEFR
- SPT to aeroallergens or specific IgE
- advise flu vaccine anually and pneumococcal every 5-10 years
- drugs

#

- SABA (alone if minimal sx and normal lung function)
- Low dose (<400mcg budesonide or equiv) ICS (asthma related sx 3x / week or causing waking at night / ADL limitation - RCP 3 qs - not relieved by SABA)
- Add LTRA
- Add LABA and stop LTRA if it didn't help

#

- Offer MART regimen
- Increase to moderate dose (400mcg-800mcg budesonide or equiv) ICS (MART or not)
- Increase to high dose (>800mcg budesonide or equiv) ICS (MART or not) OR trial of additional drug e.g LAMA or theophylline OR advice from HCP with asthma expertise (consider azithromyicin, biologics (anti-IgE omalizumab, anti-IL5 mepolizumab and reslizumab and benralizumab, anti-IL4 dupilumab, low dose oral steroids)
