With thanks to Smita Adhikari who suggested helpful pictures to me.

# Learning objectives

#

At the conclusion of this activity, participants will be able to...

- define asthma
- describe the basic epidemiology of asthma
- summarise the key clinical features of asthma
- describe the management of asthma
- assess asthma severity and know when and how to refer

# what is asthma?


# {data-background="images/asthma_airway.png"}

asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by:

1. variable and recurring symptoms (typically intermittant cough, wheeze and breathlessness)
2. airway inflammation
3. airflow obstruction
4. bronchial hyperresponsiveness


# who gets asthma?

#

- it's the most common inflammatory disease of the lungs.
- estimated worldwide burden 235 million (WHO), UK has among highest country rates.
- 5.4 million people in UK recieveing rx for asthma, 1 in 11 children, 1 in 12 adults. 3 people die from an asthma attack per day. (asthma UK)
- bimodal age distribution, equal sex distribution below 30-34, more common in men thereafter

# what causes asthma?

Causes of asthma are not completely understood. The strongest risk factors for developing asthma are a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental exposure to inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways, such as:

- indoor allergens (for example house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander)
- outdoor allergens (such as pollens and moulds)
- tobacco smoke
- chemical sensitisers and irritants in the workplace
- air pollution

- airway inflammation (mast cells, eosinophils, lymphocytes etc)
- bronchial hyperresponsiveness
- airway remodelling
- modulatory factors (genetic, environmental, infectious)
